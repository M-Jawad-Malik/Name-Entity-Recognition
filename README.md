# Name-Entity-Recognition (NER) 

## Description

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) project that identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) in a given text. This project uses a deep learning model to perform NER tasks.

## Introduction

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, allowing the identification and categorization of entities in a given text. This project employs a deep learning model for accurate and efficient NER.

## Features

- Advanced deep learning model for Named Entity Recognition.
- Web interface for users to input text and receive NER predictions.
- Training script for updating and fine-tuning the NER model.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or later)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git https://github.com/M-Jawad-Malik/Name-Entity-Recognition.git
cd NER
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the NER web application and access it through your web browser.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser and input text for NER predictions.
